    <meta property="og:description" content="I am an Assistant Professor at the College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ha'il, Saudi Arabia. As a tutor and researcher at the College of Computer Science and Engineering (CCSE) my role is to support the institutional objectives that promote higher education, high quality research, skills and knowledge transfer with external collaborations. My research expertise are in the area of software engineering to conduct independent research, supervise academic thesis and produce publishable and applicable results. Although the ‘keywords’ to best describe my research interests can be listed as Software Evolution, Software Architectures, or more precisely Architecture-Centric Software Evolution. However, I am more excited to learn about and possibly apply some interesting synergies that exist among biological evolution, architectures in the real world and in development and evolution of software architectures." />
